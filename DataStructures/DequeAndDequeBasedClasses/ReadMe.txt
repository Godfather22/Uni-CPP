This implementation of Deque has a lot in common with the vector implementation, although the real deque is based on lists, I still believe that such an implentation is very useful and faster. The Deque2 implementation(based on Vector) is not that effective, because pop_front is extremely slow, but the problem is that Vector is not intended to be Deque. This implementation has a lot in common with the Queue implementation, because it uses a counter for the beginning, but now it has some additional functions and acts like a combination between Vector and Queue.
