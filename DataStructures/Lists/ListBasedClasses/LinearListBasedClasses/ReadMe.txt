As the directory name suggests these are implementations of data structures based on linear lists, it's important to note that because of the method used to implement the linear lists, a linear list cannot be entirely empty, because then it will be nullptr and therefore useless(this problem will be resolved when I create a list structure that acts like a container)

-Queue3 is a queue based on LinearList1, I chose it, because it uses dynamicly allocated memory and is easier for use, while it consumes a lot of memory, it is also fast and has lower chance to emit an exception
