These are my own implementations of some of the most popular data structures in c++.

The folders in this directory are:
-Lists (contains several implementations of linked lists)
-src (contains src code , e.g. own implementation of shared_ptr)
-UniProjects (contains data structures that I used for my uni homeworks and projects)
-VectorAndVectorBasedClasses (contains own implementation of std::vector and several classes that inherit it) 
-Trees contains implementations of tree structures(e.g. binary search tree)
