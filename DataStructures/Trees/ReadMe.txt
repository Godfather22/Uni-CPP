BinarySearchTree2 - and implementation of a binary search tree that contains a structure - Branch (i chose a structure, because its only role will be to contain data its only function is swap), Branch contains a pointer to its parent. The purpose of BinarySearchTree is to be a stable parent for my implementation of a red-black tree.
