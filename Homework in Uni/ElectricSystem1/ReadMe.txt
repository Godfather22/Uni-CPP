This task was given to the informatics course and I did it for fun
The task was to create a 3 classes:
-date a data structure that obviously represents a date
-tool - more like an electric device whose class members represent some info about it, most importantly how much power it needs
-system contains multiple tools and has some class members that give info about its state. Probably the most import class member is storage, because if there is not enough power inthe system it cannot have more tools connected to it

The task is simple, the main problem with it was the restricted time of 60 minutes, which I also wanted to try
