The task was to create 2 classes and train operator overloading:
- ElectricDevice a simple class with two class members - name and data usage
- ElectricNet a container for Electric Device objects that has some overloaded operators. As a container ElectricNet can contain many ElectricDevice objects, as long as the sum(m_CurUsage) of their usage doesn't exceed the ElectricNet m_MaxUsage class member

The String class is the same as that in DataStructures
