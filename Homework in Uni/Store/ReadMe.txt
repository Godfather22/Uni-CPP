A task that required us to use 2 classes that interact with each other.

There are 2 classes:
-Product we had to choose a product type ad choose some class members for it
-Store a Product container that also had to interact with the products within by changing and printing them

I also used own implementation of strlen

*note that this was one of my first oop tasks and my style was lamer, I also didn't have any own implementations like String and Vector
